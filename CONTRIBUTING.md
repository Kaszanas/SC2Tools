# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project. All contributions are welcome — whether bug reports, documentation improvements, examples, or code changes.

## Guiding principles

- Keep changes small, focused, and well described in the pull request.
- Where appropriate, include tests and update documentation.
- Follow the existing coding style and conventions used in the submodule you are changing.
- Open an issue to discuss larger or non-obvious changes before submitting a pull request.

## Module-specific guidelines

This repository is organized into multiple submodules and tools. Please check the contribution guidelines that may exist inside each submodule directory, see the `README` or `CONTRIBUTING` files. Submodule-level guidance takes precedence for that area of the codebase.

If a submodule does not include its own guidelines, follow the general points above and open an issue if you need clarification.

## Submitting changes

- Fork the repository or create a branch in a fork. For submodules, this is typically done in the context of the submodule's own repository.
- Make incremental, well-scoped commits with clear messages.
- Submit a pull request describing the purpose and scope of the change and any testing performed.

## License and contributor agreement

Please refer to each of the submodules for any specific licensing or contributor agreement requirements. In general, contributions should be made under the same license as the project, and you may be asked to sign a contributor license agreement (CLA).

## Need help?

If you're unsure where to start or you have questions, please open an issue describing what you'd like to do and a maintainer will help route it.

Thank you for helping improve this project.
